---

### **CTA STRATEGY AND CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY**

#### CTA Requirements - First Person Possessive:
Primary CTAs MUST use first-person possessive language to create ownership bias and remove command undertones.

*   ❌ "Get a quote" (generic command)
*   ❌ "Get your free quote" (directed command, less ownership)
*   ✅ "Get my free quote" (self-initiated, ownership)
*   ✅ "Start my project" (user claims action)
*   ✅ "Book my consultation" (internal motivation)
*   ✅ "Claim my assessment" (autonomous action)

Exception: Navigational and informational CTAs use standard language:
*   "View our services" (not "View my services" - awkward)
*   "Learn more" (not "Learn my more" - incorrect)
*   "Contact us" (not "Contact my team" - weird)

#### Multi-Path Conversion Strategy:

**High Intent Visitors (Ready to Convert):**
*   Primary CTA in hero
*   Quote/booking CTAs throughout
*   Phone number visible

**Medium Intent Visitors (Researching/Comparing):**
*   Service page links prominent
*   "Learn more" options
*   Trust signals visible

**Low Intent Visitors (Early Stage):**
*   About us information
*   Service overview
*   Areas served details

---

*   Concise sentences with minimal adverbs
*   Active voice at all times

*   NO adjectives except:
    *   When describing company credentials (established, certified, insured)
    *   When factually accurate (family-run, independent, local)
