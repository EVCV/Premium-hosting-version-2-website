## PRIMARY ENTITY POSITIONING

### Entity-First Requirements:
- **H1**: Must contain primary entity (exact match or close variant)
- **H2s**: Must contain primary entity or direct component
- **Topic Sentences**: First sentence of each major section must include entity
- **Body Copy**: Natural variation allowed while maintaining entity focus
- **Tables**: First column must always begin with primary entity or direct component

### Entity Optimization Strategy:
- Focus on entities, not keywords
- Entities must match Google's NLP interpretation
- Create clear entity relationships (service-benefit, problem-solution)
- Use semantic triple syntax (subject-predicate-object) naturally throughout
- Entity disambiguation early in content (e.g., clarify "Fencing" as boundary installation, not the sport)

### First Person Plural Voice:
- Lead with "We do", "We handle", "Our services" in body content
- Example flow: "We install [service] → you receive [benefit] → we handle [process]"
- Establishes authority and ownership
- Maintains conversational, professional tone

---

## SECTOR-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

- Address common concerns about costs/complexity

---

## TEMPLATE INTEGRATION

### Structure Requirements:
- Follow exact structure provided in template document
- Maintain consistent entity positioning across all sections
- Adhere to word count limitations for each section
- Use specified formatting (bullets, numbered lists, tables)

### Template Adaptation Rules:
The template structure is fixed, but content within sections adapts to service type.

**If a section is not applicable:**
- Replace with closest equivalent that serves same user need
- Maintain heading structure and entity positioning
- Keep section word count similar

**Examples:**
- "Installation Process" becomes "Consultation Process" (professional services)
- "Installation Process" becomes "Treatment Process" (health services)
- "Installation Process" becomes "Onboarding Process" (B2B services)

---

## CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS

### Accuracy and Honesty Requirements:
- Only make factual claims that can be objectively verified
- Avoid industry-specific jargon or metrics that aren't officially recognized
- Don't present company methodologies as industry standards
- Be transparent about realistic timeframes and expectations
- Focus on specific, measurable benefits rather than vague claims
- Never claim unique capabilities that are standard industry practices
- Clearly distinguish between guaranteed outcomes and potential benefits
- Avoid proprietary terminology suggesting special or exclusive methods

### Search Intent Alignment:
- Content must directly address commercial search intent
- Each section must answer specific user questions
- Sufficient depth to satisfy search intent without unnecessary elaboration

### Readability Standards:
- Reading level appropriate for target audience (typically 7th-9th grade)
- Hemingway-style principles: short, clear sentences, simple words, active voice
- Active voice at all times
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences maximum) for mobile readability
- Clear topic sentences with semantic coherence
- No toxic sentences or toxic words

### Semantic Requirements:
- Semantic triple syntax throughout (subject-predicate-object relationships)
- Natural language without labeling the triples
- Semantic, lexical content - no duplicate content
- Cohesion and sentiment between headings and main entity
- Incorporate semantically related terms without keyword stuffing

---

## SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY

### Differentiate Through (Without Competitor Mention):
- Specific inclusions provided as standard
- Guarantees and commitments offered
- Process transparency points
- Unique service scope elements
- Certifications and credentials
- Our methodology and approach

### Never Include:
- Competitor names or brands
- "Unlike others" or "Better than" language
- Comparative claims to unnamed competitors
- Any reference that introduces competitor entities

---

## CTA STRATEGY AND CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY

### CTA Requirements:
- Action-oriented with possessive pronouns
- Personal ownership language
- Specific next steps

### CTA Psychology - First Person Possessive:
Primary CTAs MUST use first-person possessive language to create ownership bias and remove command undertones.

- ❌ "Get a quote now" (generic command)
- ❌ "Get your free quote" (directed command, less ownership)
- ✅ "Get my free quote" (self-initiated, ownership)
- ✅ "Start my project" (user claims action)
- ✅ "Book my consultation" (internal motivation)
- ✅ "Claim my assessment" (autonomous action)

Exception: Navigational and informational CTAs use standard language:
- "View our services" (not "View my services" - awkward)
- "Learn more" (not "Learn my more" - incorrect)
- "Contact us" (not "Contact my team" - weird)

### CTA Placement:
- After key benefit sections
- Following objection handling content
- At natural decision points
- Final section before footer

### CTA Types:
- **Primary CTA**: Main conversion action (quote, booking, consultation)
- **Secondary CTA**: Information gathering (guide, checklist, contact)
- **Soft CTA**: Engagement actions (learn more, view examples)

---

## TABLE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### Table Standards:
- All tables must contain exact number of columns specified in template
- Each column maintains consistent formatting and content type
- First column must always begin with primary entity or direct component
- Tables comprehensive while remaining service-specific
- WordPress compatible markdown format

### Formatting for WordPress Compatibility:
All tables MUST use markdown code block format:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
```

---

## LANGUAGE AND STYLE REQUIREMENTS

### British English Standards:
- British grammar conventions throughout
- British spelling (optimise, colour, programme, centre, etc.)
- Natural British phrasing and terminology

### Writing Style:
- Natural language prioritizing user experience
- Concise sentences with minimal adverbs
- Active voice at all times
- Simple vocabulary

- Clear hierarchy with appropriate H2 structure
- Bullet points and numbered lists only where specified

### Prohibited Superlatives and Adjectives:
- NO superlatives (best, greatest, leading, top, etc.)
- NO adjectives except:
  - Sparingly in H1/H2 when relevant to entities
  - In Industry Standards sections if directly linked to relevant entities
  - In Implementation Process sections if directly linked to relevant entities

**POST 2: SEASONAL (Create if applicable)**

   - Why act now (seasonal timing OR general availability)

3. **Call-to-Action** (Final sentence)
