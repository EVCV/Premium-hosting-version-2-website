---

## OFFER ENTITY POSITIONING

### Entity-First Requirements

- **H1**: Must contain the primary `[OFFER_ENTITY]` (exact match or close variant)
- **H2s**: Must reinforce the value of the `[OFFER_ENTITY]`
- **Topic Sentences**: First sentence of each section must relate to the offer

### Entity Optimization Strategy

- Focus on the `[OFFER_ENTITY]` and its relationship to the user's problem
- Create clear entity relationships (offer-benefit, problem-offer)
- Use semantic triple syntax (subject-predicate-object) naturally
- Disambiguate the offer early (e.g., "This free guide contains...", "This voucher provides...")

### First Person Plural Voice

- Lead with "We provide", "We created", "Our offer includes"
- Example flow: "We created [offer] → you receive [benefit] → you can [action]"
- Establishes authority and a direct line of communication

---

---

## TEMPLATE INTEGRATION

- Use specified formatting (bullets, numbered lists, tables)

### Template Adaptation Rules

The template structure is fixed, but content adapts to the `[OFFER_TYPE]`.

**If a section is not applicable:**

- Replace with the closest equivalent that serves the conversion goal.
- Maintain heading structure and entity focus.

**Examples:**

- "What You'll Learn" (for a Guide) becomes "What's Included" (for a Discount/Service Feature).
- "How to Claim Your Offer" (for a Coupon) becomes "How to Get Your Guide" (for a Download).

---

## CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS

### Accuracy and Honesty Requirements

- Only make factual claims about the offer that can be verified.
- Be transparent about any terms, conditions, or expiry dates.
- Focus on specific, measurable benefits rather than vague claims.
- Never claim unique capabilities that are standard industry practices.
- Clearly distinguish between guaranteed outcomes and potential benefits.

### Search Intent Alignment

- Content must directly match the expectation set by the ad or link the user clicked.
- Each section must persuade the user to complete the `[CONVERSION_GOAL]`.
- Provide just enough information to drive a decision, without overwhelming.

### Readability Standards

- Reading level appropriate for `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]` (typically 7th-9th grade).
- Hemingway-style principles: short, clear sentences, simple words, active voice.
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences maximum) for mobile scannability.
- No toxic sentences or toxic words.

### Semantic Requirements

- Semantic triple syntax throughout (subject-predicate-object relationships).
- Natural language without labeling the triples.
- Cohesion and positive sentiment between headings and the `[OFFER_ENTITY]`.

---

## SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY

### Differentiate Through (Without Competitor Mention)

- The specificity and value of the offer itself.
- Guarantees and commitments associated with the related service.
- Process transparency for claiming and using the offer.
- Certifications and credentials that build trust in the provider.

### Never Include

- Competitor names or brands.
- "Unlike others" or "Better than" language.
- Any reference that introduces competitor entities or offers.

---

## CTA STRATEGY AND CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY

### CTA Requirements

- Action-oriented, matching the `[CONVERSION_GOAL]`.
- Use possessive pronouns to create ownership.
- Create a sense of urgency or exclusivity where appropriate (`[OFFER_VALIDITY]`).

### CTA Psychology - First Person Possessive

Primary CTAs MUST use first-person possessive language to create ownership bias.

- ❌ "Submit" (generic command)
- ❌ "Get your free guide" (directed command)
- ✅ "Get my free guide" (self-initiated, ownership)
- ✅ "Claim my 20% discount" (user claims action)
- ✅ "Book my free consultation" (internal motivation)
- ✅ "Send my case study" (autonomous action)

### CTA Placement

- Prominently in the hero section ("above the fold").
- After key benefit sections.
- In the final section of the page.

---

### Table Standards

- Use tables or bulleted lists to clearly break down what the offer includes.
- First column/main points must always relate to the `[OFFER_ENTITY]`.

### Formatting for WordPress Compatibility

All tables MUST use markdown code block format:

```markdown
| Feature / Component | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Data 1              | Data 2      |
```

---

## LANGUAGE AND STYLE REQUIREMENTS

### British English Standards

- Concise sentences with minimal adverbs.
